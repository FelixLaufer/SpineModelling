# SpineModelling
Improved anatomical spine model with a vertebral resolution for inertial tracking with three inertial sensors placed near the spinal turning points between the transition zones of the lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine. Imposing natural range of motion constraints for the natural nonuniform ranges of movement along the spine yields improved tracking closely following the optical marker based reference trajectories.
